# GooAQ ðŸ¥‘: Google Answers to Google Questions! 

This repository contains the code/data accompanying our recent work on long-form question answering.   

**NOTE** This dataset should not be used for any commercial purposes. See the [license](LICENSE) for the detailed terms.

## Data 
To get the data, see the [`data/`](data/) directory.
Note that the data is stored via [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com/). 
If you're cloning the project (`git clone git@github.com:allenai/gooaq.git`), make sure to also run `git lfs pull` as well.    
 
Each row of the data file should look like this: 
```json
{
  "id": 3339543,
  "question": "what is the difference between collagen and whey protein?",
  "short_answer": null,
  "answer": "The main differences between the amino acid profiles of whey and collagen are that whey contains all 9 essential amino acids, while collagen only has 8. ... Collagen is a fibrous protein found in the skin, cartilage, and bones of animals whereas whey comes from milk.",
  "answer_type": "feat_snip"
}
```
where the questions `question` are collected via Google auto-complete.  
The answers responses (`short_answer` and `answer`) were collected from Google's answer boxes.
The answer types (`answer_type`) are inferred based on the html content of Google's response. 
Here is the dominant types in the current dataset:  
 - `feat_snip`: explanatory responses; the majoriy the question/responses are of this type. 
 - `collection`: list responses (e.g., steps to accomplish something). 
 - `knowledge`: typically short responses for knowledge seeking questions. 
 - `unit_conv`: questions about converting units. 
 - `time_conv`: questions about converting times. 
 - `curr_conv`: questions about converting currencies.  

Here are several more examples from the data:
